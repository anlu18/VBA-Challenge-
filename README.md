## Stock Market Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing stock market data over a three-year period (2014, 2015, and 2016) using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). The objective is to develop a script that efficiently processes stock data for each year, extracting and calculating key metrics, including:

- **Ticker Symbol:** The unique identifier for each stock.
- **Yearly Change:** The difference between the opening price at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.
- **Percent Change:** The percentage difference between the opening price at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.
- **Total Stock Volume:** The sum of the stock's trading volume over the year.

### Sample Output
Upon running the script, the results are displayed directly in the Excel workbook. The output includes the yearly change, percent change, and total volume for each stock. 

You can view screenshots of the script's output in the `screenshots` folder within this repository. These screenshots demonstrate the script's functionality and the format of the results generated.
